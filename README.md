# Tutoring Center Ticket System Full-Stack (MERN) Web Application v1

This is a ticket system for a university tutoring center. I based this ticket system off UCSD's ECE department's tutoring center website. I integrated the website to include also CSE courses. This is following COVID-19 restrictions so tutoring is only offered via zoom.

# Dev Update

Will not implement schedule section for v1, therefore there is no professor user. Key thing I learned from this project was to plan before attempting a MERN stack application. The minimal viable product is complete.
