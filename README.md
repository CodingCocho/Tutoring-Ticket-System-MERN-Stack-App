# Tutoring Center Ticket System Full-Stack (MERN) Web Application v1

This is a ticket system for a university tutoring center. I based this ticket system off UCSD's ECE department's tutoring center website. I integrated the website to include also CSE courses. This is following COVID-19 restrictions so tutoring is only offered via zoom.
